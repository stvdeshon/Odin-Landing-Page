                    <p>This is a practice website I've made following the Odin Project curriculum. It is 
                        a mock-up of a site advertising hiking in the central and northern regions of Idaho's 
                        backcountry.

                        Trips through the backcountry are difficult yet rewarding. Beautiful and yet disquieting. The isolation is amazing 
                        and it poses great risks, but what is life without risks? Difficulty increases greatly at higher elevations but 
                        the health benefits feel great!
